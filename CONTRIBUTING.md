# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Personal CRM. Bug reports, ideas, and code are all welcome.

## Reporting bugs

Search the [existing issues](https://github.com/abdullahmorrison/personal-crm/issues) first. If it's new, open an issue with:

- what you did
- what you expected
- what happened instead
- your device and browser, if it's a display problem

Screenshots help.

## Suggesting features

Open an issue describing the problem you want solved, not just the solution. Saying how you'd use it helps decide whether it fits the app.

    npm run lint
    npm run typecheck
    npm test
